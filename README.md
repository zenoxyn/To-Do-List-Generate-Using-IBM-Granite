# Smart To-Do List App

## üìã Description
This is a simple and responsive To-Do List web application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.  
The app is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla JS), and is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

> ‚ú® The entire development process was accelerated with the help of IBM Granite AI through few-shot prompting, which assisted in code generation and documentation.

## ü§ñ AI Support Explanation
- IBM Granite AI was used throughout the development process to:
- Generate initial HTML layout (form, task list, structure)
- Create clean and consistent CSS styling
- Write core JavaScript functions (addTask(), deleteTask(), etc.)
- Generate JSDoc-style documentation for each function
- Speed up development via few-shot prompting using contextual examples

Although AI helped in the development phase, it is not part of the deployed application. All logic runs fully client-side.
